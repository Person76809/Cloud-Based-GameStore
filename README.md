A game-website 

native React application that interacts with the backend API, you'll need to set up a new React project and implement the necessary components. Here's an example of how you can structure your React code: 

First, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

Create a new React project using Create React App: 
npx create-react-app game-store

Navigate to the project directory: 
cd game-store

Install the necessary dependencies: 
npm install axios


Start the React development server:
npm start

Now, you should be able to access the React application at http://localhost:3000. The app will fetch the game data from the Flask backend API and display it. When you click the "Download" button for a game, it will trigger the download request to the backend.

Make sure your Flask backend is running on a separate terminal window while running the React app.

Remember to adjust the API endpoint URLs if your backend is hosted on a different server or port.

Feel free to customize the React components and styles according to your preferences and design requirements.
